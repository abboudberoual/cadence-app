Make sure to manage your hamstring tightness by incorporating proper warm-ups, cool-downs, and flexibility exercises. Also, ensure you're adequately hydrating and recovering, especially considering your difficulties with heat adaptation. If you have any questions or need additional support, feel free to ask!"

The \"Ride Afternoon Ride\" indicated a duration of 150 minutes, but it shows a distance of 0.0 km, which suggests that the session might not have been recorded correctly or it may not have been an actual ride outside.\n\nIf you intended to ride and have more data on that session, please share it, and I can help analyze it further. For future rides, make sure your equipment is functioning well to capture the data accurately, especially if it\u2019s an important part of your training leading up to Ironman 70.3 Malaysia."

    "content": "Thanks for clarifying that you rode on an indoor trainer at the gym! Since the session was recorded without distance, it will still contribute significantly to your training, especially for building endurance and power in a controlled environment.\n\nFor future indoor trainer sessions, if possible, try to monitor your power output, even if you don't have a power meter. Many indoor trainers provide data on perceived exertion, heart rate, and cadence, which can be very useful for tracking your performance and improving your fitness.\n\nAs you prepare for your goal race in November 2025, consider varying your trainer sessions by including intervals, longer steady-state efforts, and recovery rides to maximize your fitness while managing any concerns related to heat adaptation and hamstring tightness.\n\nLet me know if you'd like assistance with structuring your indoor training sessions or any other aspect of your preparation!"
